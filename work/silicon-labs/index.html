        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>Silicon Labs is a leading global manufacturer of integrated-circuit products based here in Austin, Texas. Their technology helps power solutions for the Internet of Things, Internet infrastructure, industrial control, consumer and automotive markets.
        </p>
        <p>We were tasked with redesigning parts of silabs.com in an attempt to increase sales and improve ease of use across all device types.
        </p>
        <h3>The Workshop</h3>
        <p>We kicked the project off with a day-long workshop at the Silicon Labs office that would help all involved align on:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Business objectives</li>
          <li>Personas and target audience</li>
          <li>Content needs</li>
          <li>Brand characteristics</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Workshops like these are a great way to get everyone on the same page early on in a project. A full day of collaboration with the client is invaluable in helping us understand their goals, current pain points, and how we can help them improve their business.
        </p>
        <h3>Product Filtering</h3>
        <p>One of the more complicated sections we were tasked with redesigning was the Microcontroller Units (MCU) product area. Silicon Labs offers hundreds of MCU products in a variety of configurations. Our goal was to display these products in a simple, understandable way that helped users determine the differences between them and ultimately pick which was the right one for their project.
        </p>
        <p>After explorations into graphs, matrices, and other visualizations of products, we eventually determined that a product table with dynamic filtering was going to be the best solution. Only the most important parameters were included as to not overload the user with too many options and to help them easily determine which product family was right for their project.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>After selecting a product family, the user is then presented with a product matrix that includes a variety of technical specifications for each item. In order to keep the matrix a reasonable size and to help users easily compare specs that varied between individual products, we rolled up all common specifications into a table that lived above the product matrix.

        <h3>Home and Navigation</h3>
        <p>We also reworked the siteâ€™s home page and global navigation in an attempt to help the user focus on the most important navigation items / content.

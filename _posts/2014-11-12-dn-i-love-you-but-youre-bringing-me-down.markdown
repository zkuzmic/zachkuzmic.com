Over the past year or so, I’ve really come to appreciate [Designer News](https://news.layervault.com/). It keeps me up on the latest design trends (as well as [other amazing things](http://www.dinostatues.com/)) and is an awesome community full of people I can relate to. For the longest time, clicking every link on the front page of DN was just part of my morning routine.

But I had to finally stop. I’ve reached maximum capacity for the time being. I am suffering from information overload. 

For now, I need to spend less time reading and more time *doing*. That’s not to say that I’m going to stop learning. I’m just shifting the source of that learning from reading to *actual hands on experience*. I need time to focus on actually *applying* the concepts and techniques I’ve read about and observed over the past few years. 

I’ll be back to visiting DN regularly at some point again, I think. Until then, I’m going to spend my free time making stuff and honing my craft.

Similar to the way James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem feels about New York... *DN I love you, but you’re bringing me down*.

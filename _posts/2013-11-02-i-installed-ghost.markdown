I just installed [Ghost](http://ghost.org/) today. There are still some kinks to work out, and it's not pretty yet... but it's here.

And this is my first blog post. It's not particularly profound... but it's here.

One of the biggest takeaways I've gleaned since joining [JFDI](http://jfdi.bz/) (a community for solo-founders, bootstrappers, or anyone launching their own thing) is that you just have to get _something_ out there. You have to _just fucking do it_. It doesn't matter if it's perfect (or even close to it). You'll have time to make it perfect later. Right now, you just need to launch something.

So here it is, version 0.01 of the blog. Look for updates soon.

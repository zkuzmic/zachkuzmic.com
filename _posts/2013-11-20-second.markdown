Nice. It's a second post. 

I'm unreasonably proud of the fact that I am writing here for a second time. I've started blogs before, with big dreams about all of the really cool things I was going to say and all the awesome internet friends I would make. I'd spend hours styling the thing and then write a lame _"First Post!"_... 

And then I'd never touch the thing again. 

Things are different now. I'm turning over a new leaf. I'm going to _follow through_ and _actually finish things_. What a concept!

And I'm not just referring to this blog. I'm talking about side projects I've started, books I want to read, hobbies I have, goals I set for myself... So many things I've started and never finished... 

**My plan for getting things done is this:**

1. Pick a few small tasks I know I can get done
2. Set a deadline that isn't very far out

To add some extra accountability for my next set of goals, I'm going to post my task list here with the due date (12/13). **If I don't have all of these things done by December 13, 2013, please feel free to berate me via social media ([@zkuzmic](https://twitter.com/)):**

* Launch [whatthehellisawireframe.com](http://www.whatthehellisawireframe.com/)
* Style blog to match the rest of [zachkuzmic.com](http://zachkuzmic.com/) - _completed 11/22_
* Write one more blog post - _completed 12/10_
* Read _[The Shape of Design](http://www.shapeofdesignbook.com/)_ by [Frank Chimero](http://frankchimero.com/) - _completed 12/9_

I'll update this post when I'm **finished**.

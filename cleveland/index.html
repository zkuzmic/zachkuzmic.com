		Being a fan of Cleveland professional sports hurts. Over the years, they have found ways to consistently disappoint their fanbase. The Trade, The Catch, The Fumble, The Shot, and The Drive are just a few of the most gut-wrenching memories in Cleveland sports history. The timeline below shows these as well as some of the other tear-inducing events the Indians, Browns, and Cavs have been a part of over the years.

		<h3>Indians' Most Recent World Series Title</h3>
		<img src="./img/years/1948-i.png" alt="1948" />
		<p>The Indians beat the Boston Braves four games to two in the 1948 World Series. It was their second time being world champions, and it is also their most recent.</p>

		<h3>The Catch</h3>
		<img src="./img/years/1954-i.png" alt="1954" />
		<p>Willie Mays of the New York Giants makes his famous over-the-shoulder catch during the 1954 World Series at Polo Grounds. The Catch preserved a tie game that the Giants were able to win in ten innings. The Giants swept the Indians in the series.</p>

		<h3>The Trade</h3>
		<img src="./img/years/1960-i.png" alt="1960" />
		<p>On the day before the 1960 season was to open at Cleveland Stadium, General Manager Frank Lane traded star power hitter Rocky Colavito to the Detroit Tigers for Harvey Kuenn, batting champion of 1959. The trade was extremely unpopular in Cleveland and began what Cleveland fans call "The Curse of Rocky Colavito". The Indians did not win the American League Championship or even reach the playoffs again until 35 years later in 	1995.</p>

		<p>Paul Brown, with a career record of 167-53-8 (.759) while head coach for the Browns, was fired after the 1962 season. He was the winningest coach in Cleveland Browns history. Brown went on to head an ownership group that brought the Cincinnati Bengals into the American Football League in 1967.</p>

		<p>The Cavs dropped their first fifteen games in a row... after which they won a single game and lost another twelve straight (bringing their record to 1-27). Their final record of 15-67 was the worst in the league that year, and they had fourteen less wins than the second worst team in the league (the Portland Trailblazers who were also an expansion team in 1970).</p>

Two days before the Cavs were to face the Boston Celtics in game one of the Eastern Conference Final, center Jim Chones, the team's leading scorer, broke his foot in practice.

		<p>With less than a minute play, the Browns trailed the Oakland Raiders 12-14. They were on the Raiders' 13-yard line, and ran the famous play: "Red Right 88". Quarterback Brian Sipe was intercepted by Mike Davis, and the Raiders were able to hold on to win the game. They went on to win the Superbowl that year.</p>

		<p>The Cavs lost their last 19 games in the 1981-82 season and ended up with a record of 15-67. They began the 1982-83 season with five straight losses to bring the losing streak to 24 games total. At the time, it was the longest losing streak in NBA history.</p>

		<p>It was late in the fourth quarter and the Broncos were pinned on their own 2-yard line. John Elway and company drove 98 yards to tie the game at 20 and send it into overtime. A game-winning field goal sent the Broncos to the Superbowl.</p>

		<p>The Browns met the Broncos in the AFC Championship for the second year in a row. They fell behind early, but staged an impressive comeback, scoring 30 points in the second half. With just over a minute to play, the Browns were deep in Broncos territory and a touchdown seemed imminent. Running back Ernest Byner took a handoff from Kosar and fumbled on the 3-yard line. The Broncos recovered and had no trouble draining the clock to secure their second consecutive trip to the Superbowl.</p>

		<h3>The Shot</h3>
		<img src="./img/years/1989-c.png" alt="1989" />
		<p>It was game five in the first round of the 1989 playoffs against the Chicago Bulls. The Cavaliers were up by a point, 100-99, with only three seconds to play. The Bulls had an inbound pass, and Michael Jordan ended up with the ball despite being double-teamed by Cavs Craig Ehlo and Larry Nance. He proceeded to drain a jump shot from the foul line at the buzzer to make the final score 101-100. It was the second year in a row that Cleveland's playoff run ended in a game five loss to the Bulls.</p>

		<p>The Indians had the worst record in the majors at 57-105. It was their worst in franchise history. ESPN dubbed 1991 <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=city/cleveland">the worst year in Cleveland sports ever.</a></p>

		<p>The Indians had the major league's best record in 1995 at 100-44. They also led the league in hitting and pitching. However, the season's success did not translate to the 1995 World Series. The Indians lost in six games and batted just .179 in the series.</p>

That's when closer Jose Mesa came in... He blew the save and sent the game into extra innings. The Marlins (who made it into the playoffs as a wild card that year) were able to beat the Indians in eleven innings.</p>

		<h3>The Decision</h3>
		<img src="./img/years/2010-c.png" alt="2010" />
		<p>In a 75-minute TV special on ESPN, Lebron James, star player of the Cleveland Cavaliers and reigning league MVP, announced his departure from the team and that he was "taking his talents to South Beach" to play with Chris Bosh and Dwayne Wade of the Miami Heat. Many Cleveland fans accused him of quitting during the playoffs in the previous season and regarded "The Decision" as the second worst betrayal in their city's sports history (the worst being Art Modell moving the Browns from Cleveland in 1995). </p>

		<h3>Cavs Set the Record for Most Losses in a Season... again</h3>
		<img src="./img/years/2010-c-2.png" alt="2010" />
		<p>After being publicly humiliated by Lebron and company with "The Decision" TV special, the Cavaliers hit a new low. They lost 26 games in a row (the longest losing streak in NBA history) in the 2010 season, and ended with a dismal record of 19-63.</a></p>

	<p id="conclusion">There doesn't seem to be an end in sight for Cleveland fans. The Cavaliers, Browns, and Indians all continue to struggle in their respective leagues. The losing records, playoff miscues, untimely injuries, and sheer rotten luck over the years have given Cleveland fans thicker skin than any other sports fans around. Still, they continue to support their team in hopes that they will be winners again someday. Their luck will change eventually... right?</p>

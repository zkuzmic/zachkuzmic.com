Some are crude drawings on the backs of a bar napkins while others are highly detailed, computer-generated documents. Which should you create for your project? Should you add annotations?

Do they even really need a document?Answering these questions allows you to focus on your goal and helps you avoid spending egregious time creating deliverables that are overproduced or unnecessary.\n    \n3. **Build a deliverable that speaks to those needs**\nFor instance, if I'm creating wireframes for a couple of other designers I sit next to all day, I probably won't give them every single screen (just the complicated ones), and I probably won't annotate them much (if at all). Something as simple as a whiteboard sketch could work in this case.

Each day of the conference, I'll update this post with what I did that day and some of things I was able to take away from it.\n\n***\n\n#####Day 1: Friday, March 7\n\nSo it begins. Today was an incredibly hectic day. I planned on attending about five panels/discussions but was only able to make it to two due to transportation between the Austin Convention Center, Long Center, and other venues. One lesson to be had from today is to allow more time to get from point A to point B. We all know traffic in Austin is bad, but that is very much amplified during SXSW.\n\nThe most interesting discussion I attended today was with [Eric Schmidt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt) and [Jared Cohen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Cohen) of Google talking about human rights, civic relationships, and how they relate to the internet. It was a fascinating discussion about the role the internet can play in diplomacy and what sort of political issues it's dealing with and may deal with down the road.\n\nAfter the daytime events, I was able to attend parties at [Idean](http://www.idean.com/) and [Capital Factory](http://capitalfactory.com/) where I talked with so many talented designers, developers, and others in our field. It was great to see their (beautiful) spaces and talk to them about some of their experiences and what they've been up to lately.\n\n#####Day 2: Saturday, March 8\n\nThe discussion with astrophysicist [Neil deGrasse Tyson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson) today was my favorite event by far. It was equal parts informative and inspirational. While not the most directly related topic to what I do (I only deal so much with the cosmos in my day job as an interaction designer), I was able to take away a \"cosmic perspective\" of our world that speaks to staying curious, questioning everything, and doing things for the greater good. Very inspiring. \n\n#####Day 3: Sunday, March 9\n\nThe day started with NASA UXers [Steve Hillenius](https://twitter.com/Hillenius) and [Sam Hashemi](https://twitter.com/oksamuel) showing a handful of their work including mission planning software, link operation (moving those giant satellites that talk to probes in deep space), and a program for viewing and organizing content/data collected by the Mars rover (\"Pinterest for Scientists\" as they called it). Some childhood dream of mine was fulfilled looking at these astronaut interfaces and hearing about their conception. At the end of their talk, Steve and Sam showed us their checklist of the four characteristics all new NASA software should have:\n\n1. visual\n2. inviting\n3. inventive\n4. tells a story\n\nI love that storytelling is on this list.\n\nLater in the day, [WIRED](http://t.co/8JKBqw8VpR) Articles Director for Design [Cliff Kuang](https://twitter.com/cliffkuang) gave a talk on interaction design for the post-screen world. He talked about how devices need an awareness of how people live and how that can help us further collaborate with technology. My favorite line from Cliff's talk:\n\n>UX isn’t just speed. It’s context.\n\nAwesome. Sure, good UX can help users do things faster, but it isn't all about speed. User experience is about helping people accomplish their goals. Things like Google Now are taking the user's context and offering them relevant information based on what it thinks they want or are going to do next. Some are referring to this as \"predictive computing\".\n\nIt sounds like we're making progress towards building the operating system from [Her](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/).\n\n#####Day 4: Monday, March 10\n\nToday was a total blur. I made it to an interesting session midday by [Eric Swayne](https://twitter.com/eswayne) about telling stories through data. One of his major points was that although a set of data may be important, without the proper insight or visual presentation, its value might not be understood by your audience. Eric touched on some principles/techniques including [Fitt's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law) and getting to know your users' biases.\n\nLater, I made it to Stubb's to see [Girl Talk](https://twitter.com/girltalk) with a few pals I studied design with at OU: [Skye Gould](https://twitter.com/skyegould), [Alex Martinez](https://twitter.com/alx_mrtnz), and [Jered Marshall](https://twitter.com/RedMarsh5). Good times!\n\n#####Day 5: Tuesday, March 11\n\nThe last day of Interactive. Has it really been five days already? I guess time flies when you're having fun.\n\nToday, I attended Chelsea Clinton's keynote, which felt pretty dry to me. She talked about some pretty serious issues (which I can certainly appreciate), but it just lacked the motivational \"let's go change the world\" feeling I got from Neil deGrasse Tyson's keynote on day two.\n\nI also went to a panel called \"Sound Design for Web Content\" that dealt with creating audio for online video. One of the panelists, [Glenn Kiser](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0457159/) was from Dolby, and he talked about how they're leaning on YouTube to implement a 5.1 option for online videos. It sounds cool, but how many people really have a surround system attached to internet-ready devices? I'm sure that number is growing as Apple TVs and Roku boxes become more popular, but it might take a little more demand before YouTube adds the feature.\n\n***\n\n###In Summary\n\nSXSW was absolutely incredible. It was mentally and physically exhausting to be sure, but between the panels and getting to meet *so* many other talented people in our industry, it was well worth it. I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat and am already giddy with excitement for next year.","html":"<p>I'm lucky enough to have been given a platinum badge by Pearson, the company I work for, and felt like I should keep a little journal of the experiences I'm having as I navigate the beast that is South by Southwest for the first time.

Some childhood dream of mine was fulfilled looking at these astronaut interfaces and hearing about their conception. At the end of their talk, Steve and Sam showed us their checklist of the four characteristics all new NASA software should have:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>visual  </li>\n<li>inviting  </li>\n<li>inventive  </li>\n<li>tells a story</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I love that storytelling is on this list.</p>\n\n<p>Later in the day, <a href=\"http://t.co/8JKBqw8VpR\">WIRED</a> Articles Director for Design <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cliffkuang\">Cliff Kuang</a> gave a talk on interaction design for the post-screen world. He talked about how devices need an awareness of how people live and how that can help us further collaborate with technology. My favorite line from Cliff's talk:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>UX isn’t just speed. It’s context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Awesome. Sure, good UX can help users do things faster, but it isn't all about speed. User experience is about helping people accomplish their goals. Things like Google Now are taking the user's context and offering them relevant information based on what it thinks they want or are going to do next. Some are referring to this as \"predictive computing\".</p>\n\n<p>It sounds like we're making progress towards building the operating system from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/\">Her</a>.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"day4mondaymarch10\">Day 4: Monday, March 10</h5>\n\n<p>Today was a total blur. I made it to an interesting session midday by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eswayne\">Eric Swayne</a> about telling stories through data. One of his major points was that although a set of data may be important, without the proper insight or visual presentation, its value might not be understood by your audience. Eric touched on some principles/techniques including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law\">Fitt's Law</a> and getting to know your users' biases.</p>\n\n<p>Later, I made it to Stubb's to see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/girltalk\">Girl Talk</a> with a few pals I studied design with at OU: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/skyegould\">Skye Gould</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alx_mrtnz\">Alex Martinez</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RedMarsh5\">Jered Marshall</a>. Good times!</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"day5tuesdaymarch11\">Day 5: Tuesday, March 11</h5>\n\n<p>The last day of Interactive. Has it really been five days already? I guess time flies when you're having fun.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I attended Chelsea Clinton's keynote, which felt pretty dry to me. She talked about some pretty serious issues (which I can certainly appreciate), but it just lacked the motivational \"let's go change the world\" feeling I got from Neil deGrasse Tyson's keynote on day two.</p>\n\n<p>I also went to a panel called \"Sound Design for Web Content\" that dealt with creating audio for online video. One of the panelists, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0457159/\">Glenn Kiser</a> was from Dolby, and he talked about how they're leaning on YouTube to implement a 5.1 option for online videos. It sounds cool, but how many people really have a surround system attached to internet-ready devices? I'm sure that number is growing as Apple TVs and Roku boxes become more popular, but it might take a little more demand before YouTube adds the feature.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"insummary\">In Summary</h3>\n\n<p>SXSW was absolutely incredible. It was mentally and physically exhausting to be sure, but between the panels and getting to meet <em>so</em> many other talented people in our industry, it was well worth it. I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat and am already giddy with excitement for next year.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1394349779093,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1395024868671,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1394349779095,"published_by":1},{"id":13,"uuid":"1f692576-10db-4b13-b738-4ec34a077503","title":"UX = Science","slug":"ux-science","markdown":"Think back to elementary school when you first learned about the scientific method.

We build hypotheses, test hypotheses, analyze results, and draw conclusions. It’s how we prove whether our design solutions are achieving their goals. All of these steps are absolutely necessary in a successful UX process. \n\nLet’s break it down, step by step:\n\n####1. Ask a question\n\nThis step could take many forms. It could be a question about how to improve an existing page (e.g. “How do we improve conversion rate on product page X?”). This question could also be about a totally new product (e.g. “How can we facilitate efficient point-of-sale transactions on a mobile device?”). \n\nThink of this question as the goal of your project or the problem you are attempting to solve with your design solutions.\n\n####2. Do background research\n\nBefore you open Photoshop or even start wireframing, you need to go out and learn about the problem you are trying to solve. Learn as much as you can about the project’s subject matter. Look at competitors or similar products/sites. But even more important than any of the that, *you have to go out and talk to stakeholders*. This includes owners of the product or idea, current users (if applicable), prospective users, competing products’ users, and anyone else who may be involved with or affected by the end product. Learn about their needs and current pain points. Stakeholder groups will have varying perspectives/opinions, and this information will be *invaluable* as you construct a design solution.\n\n####3. Construct a hypothesis\n\nThis is your design solution, and it is based on the research you did in the previous step. It doesn’t have to be the perfect, final solution. In fact, it likely won’t be on your first pass, and that’s perfectly fine. You’ll have a chance to iterate later.\n\n####4. Test with an experiment\n\nUser testing! Whether you test it with five people around the office or 30 via a service like [usertesting.com](http://www.usertesting.com/), you need feedback on your designs. This is where you verify whether or not your solution is really solving the problem you were tasked with in step one.\n\n####5. Is the procedure working?\n\nAre your user tests really testing what you need them to? Isolating the pieces of your hypothesis that you want to test can be tricky. It may take a few tries to get it just right. Repeat steps 4 and 5 as needed.\n\n####6. Analyze and draw conclusions\n\nLook at the results of your user testing and determine whether your solution is achieving what it’s meant to achieve. If it is, job well done! Go on to step 7. If they don’t, it’s back to the drawing board to create a new hypothesis (step 3).\n\n####7. Communicate your results\n\nIn other words, build it! Whether this means creating a detailed spec to send off to a development team or actually coding it yourself, you know you have a successful, user-tested solution ready to be let into the wild.\n\n***\n\nYou absolutely need *all* of these steps to guarantee success when designing a user experience. Resist the temptation to skip the background research or testing steps as they are the *only* way to validate (or invalidate) the successfulness of your design. Without that, you're just guessing.\n\nI will leave you with this, from the great Neil deGrasse Tyson:\n\n![UX = Science!](/blog/content/images/2014/Aug/tumblr_n27gry5smW1r7iczwo1_1280.png)\n\n*UX = Science!*\n\nThoughts on this idea?
